# programming

This repo is a collection of various programs/scripts used when programming (competitively). I use that term loosely since I am not very good at it.

Some of these items may be incomplete or not work, which may be an unfortunate result of my force merging this branch when a correct solution was found on a different
device - for example I finish a problem on a laptop at school.
